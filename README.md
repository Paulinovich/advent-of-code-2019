# advent of code 2019
This is a collection of my solutions (and try-outs) for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com) challenges in Python. 

My focus now lies more on the problem solving, than creating fast, compact and scalable code. I'll make some effort on that in the next months and compare my methods to other solutions. At the moment I'm enjoying struggling through the puzzles too much to be bothered about optimisation. 

## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is a yearly advent calender of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any liked language, created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).

## Progress

| Day  | Part One | Part Two | 
|---|:---:|:---:|
|**Day 1**: [The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day1/part1/adventOfCode_day1.1.py)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day1/part2/adventOfCode_day1.2.py)|
|**1**:   To determine the required amount of fuel to bring Santa back to earth, we need to calculate the fuel needed for the mass of each module (mass divided by three, round down, and 2 subtracted) and add them together.
**2**:   Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module and needs to be added to the calculation for each module. Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel.|||
|**Day 2**: [1202 Program Alarm](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day2/part1/adventOfCode_day2.1.py)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day2/part2/adventOfCode_day2.2.py)|
|**1**: After our computer got fire, we have to write a program to read an Intcode program after it's restored to the '1202 program' state. The program consists of intervals of 4 integers: the operator(1 = +, 2 = \*), the index of the first value, index of the second value, index where to store the result. Returned should be the number at the first position of the program after being run.
**2**: We need to determine what pair of inputs at index 1 and 2 produces the output 19690720 and return the result of a calculation with these 2 numbers. Each of the two input values will be between 0 and 99, inclusive.|||
|**Day 3**: [Crossed Wires](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day3/part1/adventOfCode_day3.1.py)|[üí´](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day3/part2/adventOfCode_day3.2.py)|
|**1**: To fix the electricity circuit, we need to find the intersection point of two wires closest to the central port following the Manhattan Distance calculation. The wires' path is given as a list of commands containing a direction and the steps (e.g. U365 for up 365 steps). We should return the distance of the closest path crossing.
**2**: To minimize the signal delay, we have to search the intersection where the sum of both wires' steps to reach the intersection is lowest. If a wire visits a position on the grid multiple times, use the steps value from the first time it visits that position when calculating the total value of a specific intersection.|||
|**Day 4**: [Secure Container](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day4/part1/adventOfCode_day4.1.py)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day4/part2/adventOfCode_day4.2.py)|
|**1**: The password of the fuel depot is forgotten, we only remember a few facts about the passwort: The number is between 197487 and 673251, contains a pair of equal adjacent digits, and the digits do not decrease from left to right. We should find the amount of possibilities.
**2**: An Elf just remembered one more important detail: one pair of two adjacent matching digits is not part of a larger group of matching digits. We have to update the possibilities.|||
|**Day 5**: [Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day5/part1/adventOfCode_day5.1.py)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day5/part2/adventOfCode_day5.2.py)|
|**1**: We need to adjust our intcode computer from day 2 to read the diagnostic program to fix the air conditioner in the space craft. Two new instructions need to be added: opcode 3 to save input into a position, and opcode 4 to output a value of a position. We also need to prepare the computer to encounter 2 different parameter modes: a position mode and an immediate mode. The parameter modes are stored from right to left together with the opcode in the instruction. Any missing modes are 0. When starting the program with input '1', it should pass all tests by outputting 0 and produce the diagnostic code at the end.
**2**: Now it's time to extend the thermal radiators by adding in a few opcodes. Opcode 5 sets the instruction pointer to the value of the second parameter when the firt parameter is non-zero. Opcode 6 does the same but when the first parameter is zero. Opcode 7 stores 1 in the position given by the third parameter if the first parameter is less than the second one. Otherwise it stores a 0. Opcode 8 does the same but on the condition that the two first parameters are the same. This time we start the program with an input of '5'. |||
|**Day 6**: [Universal Orbit Map](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6)|[‚≠êÔ∏è](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day6/part1/adventOfCode_day6.1.py)|[üí´](https://github.com/Paulinovich/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/day6/part2/adventOfCode_day6.2.py)|
|**1**: For the next challenge we should find the most efficient routes between the local orbits. To verify the map of the orbits, the orbit count checksum need to be calculated: the total sum of direct orbits and indirect orbits.|||
